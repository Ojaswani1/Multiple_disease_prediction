# 🏥 Multiple Disease Prediction System

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a **Multiple Disease Prediction System** that predicts the likelihood of three diseases:

- **Diabetes** (using Support Vector Machine - SVM)
- **Heart Disease** (using Logistic Regression)
- **Parkinson's Disease** (using Support Vector Machine - SVM)

The project involves **data preprocessing, model training, and deployment** as a web application using **Streamlit**.
